                Procedures That Can Be Included in Your Mommy Makeover
              </h1>
              <p>
                Your Mommy Makeover with Dr. Kunal Sayani is completely customized. The most common procedures chosen by women in Mumbai and beyond include:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2 mb-3">
                <li><strong>Tummy Tuck (Abdominoplasty):</strong> This is often the cornerstone of a Mommy Makeover. It removes excess, loose skin and fat from the abdomen and, crucially, repairs separated abdominal muscles (diastasis recti) to create a firmer, flatter, and more toned midsection.</li>
                <li><strong>Breast Lift (Mastopexy):</strong> To address sagging and restore a more youthful, perkier position, a breast lift elevates the breast tissue and repositions the nipple and areola higher on the chest wall.</li>
                <li><strong>Breast Augmentation:</strong> To restore lost volume and create a fuller, more rounded breast shape, implants are used. This is very often combined with a breast lift (Augmentation-Mastopexy).</li>
                <li><strong>Liposuction:</strong> This procedure is used to sculpt and contour the body by removing stubborn pockets of fat that are resistant to diet and exercise. Common areas include the flanks ("love handles"), thighs, back, and arms, helping to create a more harmonious overall silhouette.</li>
                <li><strong>Vaginal Rejuvenation (Labiaplasty):</strong> For some women, pregnancy and childbirth can cause changes to the labia. Labiaplasty is a procedure to reshape and reduce the size of the labia minora for improved comfort and aesthetics.</li>
              </ul>

              <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Share Your Vision:</strong> You'll have an open discussion about the specific areas of your body you wish to improve and the aesthetic results you hope to achieve.</li>
                <li><strong>Undergo a Complete Evaluation:</strong> Dr. Sayani will perform a thorough physical examination to assess your skin laxity, muscle separation (diastasis recti), breast ptosis (sagging), volume loss, and areas of excess fat.</li>
                <li><strong>Select Your Procedures:</strong> Based on his evaluation and your goals, Dr. Sayani will recommend a specific combination of procedures. He will explain in detail what each surgery entails, including incision placements, potential outcomes, and what can be realistically and safely achieved.</li>
                <li><strong>Discuss Breast Augmentation Options:</strong> If a breast augmentation is part of your plan, you will discuss implant types (silicone/saline), sizes, shapes, and profiles to select the perfect option for your body frame.</li>

                Preparing for Your Combined Surgery
              </h2>
              <p>
                Preparation for a Mommy Makeover is crucial for a safe and smooth experience. Our team will guide you through:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-2">
                <li>Obtaining necessary medical clearances and lab tests.</li>
                <li>Stopping smoking several weeks before surgery, as it can severely impair healing.</li>
                <li>Avoiding certain medications and supplements that can increase bleeding risk.</li>
                <li>Organizing substantial home support. This is the most critical preparation step for a mother. You will need a dedicated helper to manage all childcare (including lifting), cooking, and household chores for at least the first 1-2 weeks.</li>
              </ul>

                The Day of Your Transformation
              </h2>
              <p>
                Your Mommy Makeover will be performed under general anesthesia at a fully accredited surgical facility in Mumbai. Dr. Kunal Sayani will meticulously perform the selected procedures in a sequence planned for optimal safety and results. For example, he might perform liposuction first, followed by the tummy tuck, and then the breast procedure. The entire operation can take anywhere from 4 to 7 hours, depending on the complexity and number of procedures involved.

                <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> You will be encouraged to walk around the house for short periods to promote circulation, but you will need to walk in a slightly bent-over position to avoid straining your tummy tuck incision.</li>
                <li><strong>Garments & Drains:</strong> Wear your compression garments as instructed, 24/7. Our team will teach you how to manage your surgical drains, which are typically removed within a week.</li>
