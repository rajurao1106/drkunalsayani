              A New Era in Hair Loss Treatment
            </h2>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Male Pattern Baldness, medically known as{" "}
              <strong>Androgenetic Alopecia</strong>, is the leading cause of
              hair loss in men. Triggered by a combination of genetics and
              hormones (specifically
              <strong> Dihydrotestosterone (DHT)</strong>), it leads to the
              progressive shrinking of hair follicles until they no longer
              produce hair.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              The good news is that medical science has made monumental leaps in
              combating this condition. Forget the outdated notions of
              unnatural-looking "hair plugs." Today’s treatments, particularly
              those offered at our <strong>Andheri, Mumbai clinic</strong>,
              focus on creating remarkably natural, dense, and permanent
              results.
