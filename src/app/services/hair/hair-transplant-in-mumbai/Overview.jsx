            Hair transplant surgery is a highly effective and permanent solution
            for individuals experiencing various forms of hair loss, including
            male pattern baldness, female pattern hair loss, and hair1 loss due
            to trauma or scarring. The procedure involves harvesting healthy
            hair follicles from a donor area (typically the back or sides of the
            head, where hair is genetically resistant to balding) and
            transplanting them2 to areas of thinning or baldness. Under the
            expert care of Dr. Kunal Sayani, you can achieve natural-looking
            hair growth that blends seamlessly with your existing hair.
