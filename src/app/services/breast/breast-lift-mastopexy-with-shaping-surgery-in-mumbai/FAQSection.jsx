    question: "What is a breast lift with augmentation?",
    answer:
      "A breast lift with augmentation is a surgical procedure that combines a mastopexy (breast lift) to raise and reshape sagging breasts with the placement of implants to enhance volume and fullness, resulting in a more youthful and proportionate breast contour.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long should I wait after having a baby to get this surgery?",
    answer:
      "This is a crucial question. Dr. Kunal Sayani recommends you wait at least 6 months after giving birth, and, most importantly, at least 6 months after you have completely stopped breastfeeding. This allows your hormones to stabilize and your breasts to settle into their final post-lactation size and shape, ensuring a more predictable and lasting surgical result.",
  },
  {
    question: "I live outside of Mumbai. How can I manage the consultation and follow-ups?",
    answer:
      "We welcome patients from all over India and abroad to our state-of-the-art surgical center in Andheri, Mumbai. We can facilitate an initial virtual consultation to discuss your goals. For the procedure and essential post-operative checks, you will need to plan a stay in Mumbai. Our team can assist with logistical advice.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I have more children after this surgery?",
    answer:
      "Yes, you can have a healthy pregnancy after a breast lift with augmentation. However, a future pregnancy will likely alter your surgical results, causing the skin to stretch and sag again. For this reason, most surgeons, including Dr. Sayani, recommend waiting until you are certain you have completed your family.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will I be able to breastfeed a future child?",
    answer:
      "While many women can, the ability to breastfeed can be impacted. Both the lift and the augmentation procedures can potentially interfere with milk ducts and nerves. If you plan on having more children, this is a critical point to discuss in-depth with Dr. Sayani.",
  },
];

const mythsVsFacts = [
  {
    myth: "The implants will look and feel fake.",
    fact:
      "This is a common fear, but modern surgical techniques and implants have advanced significantly. By choosing the right size, shape, and placement for your body, Dr. Kunal Sayani focuses on creating results that look and feel natural, restoring youthful fullness rather than creating an artificial appearance.",
  },
  {
    myth: "I should just get a lift now and add implants later.",
    fact:
      "While possible, it's often not ideal. Addressing both volume loss and sagging in a single, combined procedure is more efficient, involves only one recovery period, and allows the surgeon to create the best possible shape by using the implant to help define the new breast contour from the start.",
  },
  {
    myth: "My breasts will be a 'D cup' if I ask for it.",
    fact:
      "Bra cup sizes are not standardized and are an unreliable goal. The aim of the consultation is to choose an implant volume (measured in cc's) that is proportional to your chest width, height, and existing breast tissue to create a balanced and beautiful result, rather than aiming for a specific letter.",
  },
  {
    myth: "I can get back to my normal routine and lifting my kids in a few days.",
    fact:
      "This is one of the most dangerous myths for mothers. Undergoing major surgery requires a significant healing period. Attempting to do too much too soon, especially lifting children, can lead to serious complications like bleeding, implant malposition, and poor scarring, compromising your entire result. Planning for adequate help is not a luxury; it's a necessity.",
