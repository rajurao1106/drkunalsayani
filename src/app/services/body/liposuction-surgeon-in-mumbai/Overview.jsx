            Liposuction, also known as lipoplasty or fat suction, is a surgical
            procedure designed to permanently remove localized fat deposits from
            various areas of the body. It's not a weight-loss solution, but
            rather a body sculpting technique for individuals who are near their
            ideal weight but have specific areas of excess fat that are
            disproportionate to the rest of their body. Under the expert care of
            Dr. Kunal Sayani, you can achieve a smoother, more defined, and
            harmonious silhouette.
