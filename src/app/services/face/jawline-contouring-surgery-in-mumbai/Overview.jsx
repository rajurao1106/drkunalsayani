            The jawline is a critical component of facial definition, framing
            the face and conveying a sense of strength, youth, and elegance. For
            many, however, a less defined jawline, often due to genetics, aging,
            or weight fluctuations, can lead to a less refined profile. Jawline
            contouring, offered by Dr. Kunal Sayani, is a highly sought-after
            aesthetic procedure designed to sculpt and refine this area,
            creating a more chiseled, symmetrical, and aesthetically pleasing
            lower face

            Whether you desire a sharper angle, a more prominent chin-jawline
            transition, or a reduction in submental fat (double chin) that
            obscures your natural jawline, Dr. Kunal Sayani offers a range of
            advanced techniques. Our approach is always individualized, taking
            into account your unique facial anatomy, aesthetic goals, and skin
            quality to achieve natural-looking and harmonious results. This
            procedure can dramatically improve your profile, reduce the
            appearance of jowls, and contribute to an overall more youthful and
            confident look.
