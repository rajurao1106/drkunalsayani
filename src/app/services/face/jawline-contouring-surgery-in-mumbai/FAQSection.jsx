    question: "Who is an ideal candidate for jawline contouring with Dr. Kunal Sayani?",
    answer:
      "Ideal candidates are individuals who are generally healthy, have realistic expectations, and are bothered by a poorly defined jawline, jowls, a double chin, or a weak chin. Specific candidacy depends on your unique anatomy and aesthetic goals, which Dr. Kunal Sayani will assess during your consultation.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do the results of jawline contouring last?",
    answer:
      "The longevity varies greatly. Non-surgical options like fillers last 12-24 months, neuromodulators 4-6 months, and Kybella results are permanent as fat cells are destroyed. Surgical procedures like liposuction and chin implants offer permanent results, though the natural aging process will continue. Facelift/neck lift results are long-lasting, often for 10-15 years.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is jawline contouring painful?",
    answer:
      "Non-surgical treatments typically involve minimal discomfort, often managed with topical numbing cream. Surgical procedures are performed under local or general anesthesia, so you won't feel pain during the procedure. Post-operative discomfort is managed with prescribed pain medication.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long is the recovery time?",
    answer:
      "Recovery for non-surgical treatments is minimal (a few hours to a few days of mild swelling/bruising). Surgical procedures require more downtime, ranging from 1-2 weeks for initial recovery to several months for complete swelling resolution and final results.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can jawline contouring help with a double chin?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! Submental liposuction or Kybella injections are specifically designed to address and eliminate a double chin, revealing a more defined jawline.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can jawline contouring make my face look more masculine or feminine?",
    answer:
      "Yes, with Dr. Kunal Sayani's expertise, jawline contouring can be tailored to enhance masculine features (e.g., a sharper, more angular jaw) or feminine features (e.g., a more refined, delicate jawline, often with a V-shape).",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the cost of jawline contouring?",
    answer:
      "The cost varies significantly based on the chosen procedure(s), the extent of treatment, and anesthesia fees (if applicable). During your consultation with Dr. Kunal Sayani, you will receive a detailed cost estimate tailored to your personalized treatment plan.",
  },
  {
    question: "Myth: Jawline contouring is only for people who are overweight.",
    answer:
      "Fact: While excess fat can obscure the jawline, many individuals with a healthy weight seek jawline contouring due to genetics, aging, or a naturally recessed chin.",
  },
  {
    question: "Myth: You can achieve a perfectly chiseled jawline with just diet and exercise.",
    answer:
      "Fact: While weight loss can improve overall facial slimness, it cannot address genetic predispositions, skin laxity, a weak chin, or an enlarged masseter muscle that contributes to a less defined jawline. Aesthetic procedures offer targeted solutions.",
  },
  {
    question: "Myth: All jawline contouring procedures are surgical and require extensive downtime.",
    answer:
      "Fact: This is false. Dr. Kunal Sayani offers a wide range of non-surgical options like dermal fillers, neuromodulators, and Kybella, which involve minimal to no downtime. Surgical options are available for more significant concerns.",
  },
  {
    question: "Myth: Jawline contouring results always look unnatural or 'done.'",
    answer:
      "Fact: When performed by a skilled and experienced surgeon like Dr. Kunal Sayani, the goal is always to achieve natural-looking, harmonious results that enhance your existing features, not drastically alter them. The key is a personalized approach and artistic precision.",
  },
  {
    question: "Myth: Jawline contouring is a one-size-fits-all procedure.",
    answer:
      "Fact: This is completely false. As highlighted by Dr. Kunal Sayani's approach, jawline contouring involves a diverse range of techniques, each tailored to the individual's specific needs, facial anatomy, and desired outcome.",
  },
  {
    question: "Myth: Injectables like fillers are permanent for jawline contouring.",
    answer:
      "Fact: While some injectables (like Kybella, for fat reduction) offer permanent results, hyaluronic acid-based dermal fillers are temporary and are naturally metabolized by the body over time. Retreatment is necessary to maintain the results.",
  },
  {
    question: "Myth: Jawline contouring is only for younger people.",
    answer:
      "Fact: While younger individuals may seek to enhance existing features, many older patients choose jawline contouring to address signs of aging such as jowls, skin laxity, and a less defined profile, restoring a more youthful appearance.",
  },
