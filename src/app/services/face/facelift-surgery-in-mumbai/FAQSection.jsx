    question: "What is a facelift?",
    answer:
      "A facelift is a surgical procedure that rejuvenates the face by tightening underlying tissues, removing excess skin, and redraping the skin to reduce sagging, jowls, and deep folds, resulting in a more youthful appearance.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the 'best' age for a facelift?",
    answer:
      "There is no magic number. The best time for a facelift is when you see significant signs of aging that concern you, such as jowling and deep facial folds. This typically occurs for people in their late 40s to 60s, but can vary.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long do the results of a facelift last?",
    answer:
      "A facelift 'turns back the clock' by about 10 years. While the results are long-lasting, your face will continue to age naturally. However, you will always look younger than if you had never had the procedure. A healthy lifestyle can help prolong the results.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will I still look like myself?",
    answer:
      "Yes. The goal of a modern facelift performed by an expert like Dr. Kunal Sayani is to make you look like a more youthful and refreshed version of yourself, not like a different person.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is the surgery painful?",
    answer:
      "The procedure is performed under anesthesia, so you will not feel pain during the surgery. Post-operative discomfort is typically mild to moderate and is well-controlled with prescribed pain medication. Most patients describe the sensation as tightness or soreness rather than sharp pain.",
  },
];

const mythsVsFacts = [
  {
    myth: "A facelift will make my skin look tight and 'pulled.'",
    fact:
      "This is the result of outdated techniques that only addressed the skin. Modern SMAS facelifts, like those performed by Dr. Kunal Sayani, create a natural lift from the foundational tissues, allowing the skin to be re-draped without tension.",
  },
  {
    myth: "'Non-surgical facelifts' like thread lifts give the same results.",
    fact:
      "While non-surgical options can provide temporary and subtle improvement, they do not address excess skin or the underlying muscle structure. A surgical facelift offers the most dramatic, comprehensive, and long-lasting results for significant facial aging.",
  },
  {
    myth: "Facelifts leave very noticeable scars.",
    fact:
      "An expert surgeon meticulously places incisions in natural creases and within the hairline to make them as inconspicuous as possible. Over time, they fade significantly and are typically very difficult to detect.",
  },
  {
    myth: "I will have to hide for months after my surgery.",
    fact:
      "While there is a recovery period, most patients are able to return to their social and professional lives within 2-3 weeks. The initial phase of significant swelling and bruising subsides relatively quickly.",
  },
